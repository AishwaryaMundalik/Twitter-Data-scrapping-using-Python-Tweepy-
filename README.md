# Twitter Data Scraping Using Python and Tweepy

## Overview

This Python program allows you to fetch data from Twitter using the `Tweepy` package, which is the official Python library for accessing Twitter's RESTful APIs. With `Tweepy`, you can easily collect tweets, user data, and other information from Twitter, making it a valuable tool for social media analysis, sentiment analysis, or research.

This method is based on the work referenced by Yanofsky, who provided a simple way to set up data scraping with `Tweepy` for Python 3.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tweepy** (Python package)

You can install the required package using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

- **Twitter Developer Account**: You need to have access to the Twitter Developer API to generate the necessary credentials (API keys and access tokens).

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/) website and create an account if you don't already have one.
2. Once logged in, create a new project and an application.
3. After creating the app, you will be given the following keys and tokens:
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret Key**
   - **Access Token**
   - **Access Token Secret**

These credentials are required to authenticate your Python script with Twitter.

### Step 2: Setup the Python Script

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/username/Twitter-Data-scrapping-using-Python-Tweepy
```

In your Python script, you need to authenticate with Twitter using the credentials from the Developer API.

```python
import tweepy

# Set up your API keys and tokens
consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

# Authenticate to the Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# Set up the Tweepy API object
api = tweepy.API(auth)
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual API credentials you obtained from your Twitter Developer account.

### Step 3: Fetching Data

Now you can use the `Tweepy` API to fetch various kinds of data. Below is an example of how to fetch recent tweets containing a specific keyword.

```python
# Example: Fetch tweets containing a keyword
keyword = "Python"
public_tweets = api.search_tweets(keyword, count=10)

for tweet in public_tweets:
    print(f"Tweet by {tweet.user.screen_name}: {tweet.text}\n")
```

This example fetches the latest 10 tweets containing the keyword "Python" and prints them.

## Available Features

- **Fetching Tweets**: You can search for tweets using a specific keyword, hashtag, or user mention.
- **Fetching User Data**: You can retrieve details of a particular Twitter user such as their followers, tweets, bio, etc.
- **Streaming Tweets**: You can use the Tweepy streaming API to collect tweets in real-time.

## Reference

This method was adapted from the following source:
- **Yanofsky's Gist**: [https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Credentials**: Ensure that your API keys and tokens are correctly copied from the Twitter Developer portal.
- **API Rate Limit**: Twitter imposes rate limits on the API usage. Be mindful of these limits to avoid getting blocked.
- **Missing Packages**: If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure to install all the required packages using `pip`.
